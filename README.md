## description

*** 
In this project our team focuses on creating a website based on the concept of "reciprocity circle", where you can seek help for something by posting something in return that other users can benefit from. Scaled for a university setting; a student in a university community can become a member and help with something. However, instead of paying for it the student would offer with her/his own resources or expertise in return.<br>
This is a CMS-style site similar to a Wordpress site, where members can publish their posts and comments on other membersâ€™ posts as well. App is following the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, and uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. It also introduces "Animista" as a new technology to enhance CSS coding. It is deployed to Heroku.
